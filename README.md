# Setting up a new ubuntu box 

This script will install the basic tools I use on a fresh Ubuntu install. It was developed using 19.04.

Most of this is automatic, with the following exceptions:


 - user will be prompted at points
 - vim plugins have to be manually instantiated (see instructions)
 - emacs: have to add a sed call to fully automate (see instructions)
 - the dropbox install needs some intervention (see instructions)
